# Rust Vim-like Editor

This is a lightweight, Vim-like text editor implemented in Rust using the `ratatui` and `crossterm` libraries. It features a built-in file explorer tree, allowing you to easily navigate and edit files within your project.

## How to Run

To build and run the editor, navigate to the project root and use Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --manifest-path rust_editor/Cargo.toml
./rust_editor/target/debug/rust_editor
```

Alternatively, you can run directly:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path rust_editor/Cargo.toml
```

To open a specific file when starting the editor (this feature is not yet implemented in Rust version, but planned):

```bash
# Planned: ./rust_editor/target/debug/rust_editor /path/to/your/file.txt
```

## Features

*   **Line Numbers**: Displays line numbers next to the text content.
