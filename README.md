# Python Vim-like Editor

This is a lightweight, Vim-like text editor implemented in Python using the `curses` library. It features a built-in file explorer tree, allowing you to easily navigate and edit files within your project.

## How to Run

To start the editor, simply run the `editor.py` script from your terminal:

```bash
python editor.py
```

You can also open a specific file by passing its name as an argument:

```bash
python editor.py /path/to/your/file.txt
```
